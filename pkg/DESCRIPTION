Description: Functionality for posterior inference, sensitivity and learning quantification in the Bayesian normal-normal hierarchical model used for Bayesian meta-analysis. Provides functions for heterogeneity prior adjustment with respect to tails or the latent model complexity for half-normal (HN), half-Cauchy (HC), exponential (EXP) and Lomax (LMX) priors. The functions operate on data sets which are compatible with the bayesmeta R package on CRAN.
